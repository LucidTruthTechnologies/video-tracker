# Motion-First Bidirectional Tracker - Implementation Progress

## Completed Tasks ‚úÖ

### Repo, Config, Run Management
- [x] [1pt] Create `config.yaml` with defaults including **zones file path** and per-zone motion bounds.
- [x] [1pt] Implement config loader with multi-file override merge via CLI `--config`.
- [x] [1pt] Add `RUN_DIR` bootstrap (timestamped) and path expansion.

### Probe and I/O
- [x] [1pt] Probe FPS, frame count, width/height; write `ffprobe.json`.
- [x] [1pt] Implement frame reader with constant-FPS guard and work-res downscale; record exact scale/pad transform.
- [x] [1pt] Detect GPU decode (NVDEC) vs CPU; log choice and codec info.

### Zones and Masks (Pipeline Consumption)
- [x] [1pt] Load `zones.json` (if provided) and build binary masks per zone in source and work spaces.
- [x] [1pt] Implement helper to compute **zone occupancy** for a box (fraction overlap) and choose the **active zone** per frame with hysteresis.
- [x] [1pt] Implement **zone-aware motion bounds** (speed, accel, scale change) and missing-measurement tolerance.

### **Zone Editor Utility** (Interactive Polygon Tool)
- [x] [1pt] CLI `zone-edit` to open a frame by `--frame-index` or `--timestamp 00:MM:SS.ff`; fall back to first frame if unspecified.
- [x] [1pt] Support alternative input `--image path.png` to draw on a still (bypasses video probe).
- [x] [1pt] Render base frame scaled to fit window; maintain **exact source‚Üíscreen** mapping to write back **source pixel** coordinates.
- [x] [1pt] Keyboard/UI controls:
  - `1..9` select zone by index/name cycle; `Tab` next zone; on first use, prompt for zone name.
  - `Left-click` add vertex; `Enter`/`c` close polygon; `n` start new polygon in active zone.
  - `Drag` on vertex to move (snap if within `snap_px`); `Backspace/z` undo last vertex; `Shift+z` redo.
  - `d` delete vertex under cursor; `r` remove last polygon in active zone; `x` delete polygon under cursor (confirm).
  - `s` save `zones.json`; `l` load existing; `h` toggle help; `=`/`-` change overlay alpha; `Esc/q` quit (confirm on unsaved changes).
- [x] [1pt] Visual cues: distinct color per zone, active zone highlighted, semi-transparent polygon fills (`overlay_alpha`), vertex markers, index labels.
- [x] [1pt] Precision: store float vertex coords in source pixels; no rounding; preserve order and multiple polygons per zone.
- [x] [1pt] Schema save:
  - Header: `{ "source_width": W, "source_height": H, "frame_index_used": f, "timestamp_used": "HH:MM:SS.ff" | null, "version": "1.0" }`
  - Zones: `[ { "name": "water", "polygons": [ [ [x,y], ... ], ... ] }, ... ]`
- [x] [1pt] Validation: on save, ensure all polygons are ‚â•3 vertices and within `[0..W-1, 0..H-1]`.
- [x] [1pt] Round-trip tests: load ‚Üí edit ‚Üí save preserves geometry; unit tests for JSON schema.
- [x] [1pt] Export a quick PNG overlay preview `zones_preview.png` (optional) with alpha composited on the frame for visual confirmation.

## Pending Tasks ‚è≥

### Optical Flow

- [x] [1pt] Implement **flow coherence** metrics (agreement ratio, max angle).

### Seed Handling
- [x] [1pt] Parse seed from CLI (`--seed-frame`, `--seed-box`) or JSON; validate bounds; store canonical **source** coords.

- [x] [1pt] Define state `[cx,cy,w,h,vx,vy,vw,vh]` and CV transition with `Œît=1/FPS`.

- [ ] [1pt] **Zone-aware gating**: Mahalanobis + IoU with per-zone thresholds.
- [ ] [1pt] **Stationary hypothesis**: when coherence < threshold and zone ‚àà {deck, bleachers}, bias to zero-velocity; prevent drift.
- [ ] [1pt] Missing-measurement mode (prediction-only) with per-zone max durations and covariance inflation.

### Optional Detector (Scale/Anchor Only, Zone-Gated)
- [ ] [1pt] Integrate optional person detector at downscaled res; map detections to source.
- [ ] [1pt] Accept at most one detection inside the KF gate and above IoU œÑ; use to re-anchor `w,h` (small `cx,cy` correction) respecting zone bounds.

### Forward Pass
- [x] [1pt] Implement forward loop `f0..F-1`: predict; derive motion measurement; **zone-aware** gating; update or skip; emit per-frame record with zone label.

- [ ] [1pt] Apply EMA to `[cx,cy]` and `[w,h]`.
- [ ] [1pt] Implement gap interpolation (linear or monotone cubic) with flags and **confidence decay** during prediction-only spans.

### Coordinate Mapping
- [ ] [1pt] Implement precise work‚Üîsource mapping (with/without letterbox); unit-test round-trip error.
- [ ] [1pt] Ensure CSV/JSONL store **source-space floats**; round only when drawing.

- [ ] [1pt] CSV-driven plots: confidence vs time, speed vs time, zone occupancy vs time.

### Performance and Chunking
- [ ] [1pt] Chunked processing (e.g., 1500 frames, 60-frame overlap) with persisted partial KF states.
- [ ] [1pt] CLI knobs for chunk size/overlap; log throughput and VRAM/CPU usage.

### Validation Tests
- [ ] [1pt] Unit: KF predict/update with zone-bound clamping.
- [ ] [1pt] Unit: work‚Üîsource mapping error < 0.5 px at 4K.
- [ ] [1pt] Synthetic integration: moving rectangle across **multiple zones** with occlusions; IoU ‚â• 0.9 after RTS; no zone-bound violations.
- [ ] [1pt] Realistic clip: seated (bleachers) remains stationary ‚â•30 s; deck walking respects speed bounds; swim respects water bounds.

### Reproducibility and Forensics
- [x] [1pt] Store SHA-256 of input MKV container and raw stream.
- [x] [1pt] Persist merged config and environment (Python/OpenCV/torch; CUDA; GPU/driver).

## Next Priority Tasks

1. ‚úÖ Implement forward tracking loop from seed frame
2. Implement backward tracking loop from seed frame  
3. Implement RTS smoothing and fusion

## Notes

- Core infrastructure, zone editor, and basic tracking components are complete
- Need to implement the main tracking pipeline loops (forward/backward)
- Kalman filter and optical flow are implemented but need integration
- Focus on getting basic tracking working before adding advanced features
- Consider implementing a simple test case first to validate the pipeline
